# Deep-Learning-Based-Communication-System


Overview:
This project extends the existing research in multi-task semantic communication by implementing a deep learning-based multi-task Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication system over wireless networks, incorporating semantic encoding and decoding principles. The system employs machine learning, information theory, and semantic communication to address cooperative multi-task processing in a wireless setting, focusing on accurate task execution and efficient transmission.
1. Introduction to Semantic Communication:
Traditional communication systems, based on Shannon’s theory, prioritize the accurate reconstruction of transmitted information, neglecting the meaning or task relevance of the information. Semantic communication emphasizes the meaning and goals behind transmitted data, focusing on task performance instead of precise bit-level reconstruction. This project is situated within the semantic communication paradigm, aiming to enhance multi-task processing in wireless networks by exploiting semantic relationships.
2. System Model and Approach:
The project employs a machine learning-driven semantic communication model based on an information-theoretic approach, incorporating key elements like probabilistic modeling, variational approximation, and infomax optimization. The system is designed to process multiple tasks simultaneously using semantic encoding and decoding techniques, consisting of the following components:
Semantic Source Modeling: Observations are associated with multiple semantic variables representing different tasks, forming a "semantic source." The model captures probabilistic relationships among these variables, allowing simultaneous extraction of multiple semantic variables from a single observation.
Cooperative Multi-Task Processing: The system features a centralized common unit (CU) encoder that extracts information relevant to all tasks, along with specific units (SUs) tailored for each task. This structure facilitates cooperation among tasks, enhancing overall task execution performance when statistical relationships exist between the tasks.
3. Components and Architecture:
The architecture integrates several components to implement semantic communication in the NOMA framework:
CU Encoder:A deep neural network-based encoder responsible for extracting common semantic features from the input data. It learns shared features across different tasks, which are then passed to task-specific SUs.
SU Encoders Each SU encoder processes task-specific information based on the output from the CU. These task-specific encoders implement dense neural network layers to encode distinct features relevant to each task.
NOMA Superposition:The encoded signals from different SUs are superimposed using power allocation techniques to simulate NOMA communication. This superposition allows the transmission of multiple signals simultaneously over a shared wireless channel.
AWGN Channel: The transmitted signals pass through an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, simulating real-world wireless conditions.
Base Station Model: A DNN-based base station model separates and decodes the received superimposed signals. The model consists of:
- A fully connected DNN that extracts relevant features from the received signal.
- Decoders corresponding to each SU, responsible for reconstructing the original semantic variables based on the received signal.
4. Training and Optimization:
The project employs end-to-end learning to optimize the entire system, integrating the communication channel into the learning process:
Objective Function: An infomax principle is applied to maximize mutual information between the channel outputs and the semantic variables. The training process aims to optimize both the CU and SU encoders and decoders jointly.
Loss Functions:
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss for Task 1 (binary classification).
Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss for Task 2 (categorical classification).
Training Strategy: A data-driven approach using the MNIST dataset is implemented, where the model learns to extract semantic information for multiple tasks simultaneously. The training process utilizes sample weighting to handle class imbalance in binary classification tasks.
5. Evaluation and Performance Analysis:
The system’s performance is evaluated based on multiple metrics, including:
Accuracy: The model’s ability to correctly decode the transmitted semantic information for both binary and categorical tasks.
Throughput Calculation: The system's throughput is calculated based on task execution accuracy, providing insight into the efficiency of the multi-task processing over the wireless channel.
Validation Error Rate:The model’s error rate during training and validation is plotted to evaluate its learning efficiency for each task.
6. Key Findings and Simulation Results:
The project demonstrates several important insights regarding cooperative multi-task semantic communication:
Cooperative Encoding: The CU encoder’s presence significantly improves task execution performance when a statistical relationship exists between tasks, reducing error rates and enhancing task accuracy.
Task Interference: Cooperative multi-task processing is not universally beneficial. When tasks are independent or exhibit no statistical relationship, cooperative processing can lead to performance degradation.
NOMA Communication: The project validates that NOMA-based superposition enhances communication efficiency, allowing simultaneous multi-task processing over a shared wireless channel.
7. Technical Implementation Details:
Tools and Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras Used for building and training deep learning models.
Scikit-learn: For class weight computation and handling data preprocessing tasks.
Python Libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
Machine Learning Techniques:

- Variational approximation techniques for optimizing probabilistic models.
8. Comparison with Existing Work:
The project builds upon and extends the research presented in the referenced paper【11†source】, which introduced an information-theoretic approach to semantic communication for cooperative multi-task processing. Key extensions include:
- Integration of NOMA: The system incorporates NOMA-based signal superposition, enabling simultaneous multi-task transmission over a shared wireless channel.

#### 9. Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates an advanced semantic communication system capable of cooperative multi-task processing over wireless networks. By leveraging deep learning, information theory, and NOMA principles, the system effectively balances accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in multi-task execution, providing a foundation for future research in task-oriented communication and semantic information theory.
